   * ALGORITHM:
   * size -> Height and width of the Z (both height and width equal)
   *
   * MATHS: A mathematical equation x * (1 - x) = x *(2 - x)
   * can be usually solved by cancelling x on both sides
   * UNLESS x = 0; In this case both sides become 0 and the equation is satisfied
   * x = 0 is therefore, another solution of the given equation.
   *
   * PATTERN: if we define the coordinates x and y
   * Then this pattern is defined by the following conditions:
   * 1) If x = (size - y); show a "@"
   * 2) If x = 0 or x = size; show a "@"
   *
   * These conditions can be written in equations
   * x = 0;
   * x = size; ie x - size = 0
   * x = size - y;
   *
   * We can now club these equations (without using logical operators)
   * x = (size - y) and (x - size) = 0 are solutions.
   * Therefore: (x - size) * x = (x - size) * (size - y)
   *
   * Also x = 0 is a solution
   * therefore, x * (x - size) * x = x * (x -size) * (size - y)
