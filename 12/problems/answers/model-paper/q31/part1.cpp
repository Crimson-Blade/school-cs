/**
 * Given two arrays of integers of sizes M and N respectively. Write a function named
 * MIX() which will produce a third array named C such that the resulting sequence is
 * followed
 * 1) All even numbers of A from left to right are copied into C from left to right.
 * 2) All odd numbers of A from left to right are copied into C from right to left.
 * 3) All even numbers of B from left to right are copied into C from left to right
 * 4) All odd numbers of B from left to right are copied into C from right to left
 * A , B and C are passed as arguments to MIX()
 * Eg:-If A ={ 3, 2 ,1 , 7, 6, 3} and B = { 9, 3, 5, 6, 2, 8, 10}
 * The resultant array C should be { 2, 6 , 6, 2, 8 , 10, 5, 3, 9 , 3, 7 , 1, 3}

   * 2) If the jth element is odd, add it to the end of the final array. DO NOT increment i.

   * Iterate over second array b:
   * 1) If the jth element is even, add it to the ith position ie from the beginning. Increment i.
   * 2) If the jth element is odd, calculate the first empty position from the end of the array
