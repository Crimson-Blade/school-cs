5. . Answer the questions (i), (ii) and (iii) after going through the following class.
class Match
{
int Time;
public :
Match (int y) 			// Constructor 1
{
 Time = y;
}
Match (Match &m); 		// Constructor 2

};
    (i) Create an object of Match such that it invokes constructor 1 with time passed as 7.
Match m(7);
    (ii) Write the function definition for constructor 2.
Match(match &m)
{
	Time= m.Time;
}
    (iii) Identify the type of constructors depicted in the above class
Constructor 1 = parameterized constructor
Constructor 2 = copy constructor
6.  Answer the questions i) ii) and iii) after going through the following program
class sports
{
int time;
public :
sports ( ) 	//function 1
{
time = 0;
}
void display ( ) 	// function 2
{
cout << “ It is a sports festival”;
}
sports ( int duration ) 		// function 3
{
time = duration;
}
sports(sports &sf ) 	//function 4
{
time =sf.duration;
}
};
i) Which feature of object oriented programming is demonstrated using function 1,
function 3 and function 4 ?    ---- Constructors
ii) Which category of constructor function 4 belongs to and what is the purpose of using it? ----------Copy constructor
iii) Identify the type of constructor depicted in function 3.-------- Parameterized constructor
iv) Identify the type of constructor depicted in function 1. When will it be invoked?
Default constructor and it is involved when a new object is being created.
v) size of the object
